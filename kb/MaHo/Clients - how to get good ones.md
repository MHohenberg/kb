1) Be the best of the best 

2) Create value for what you offer (think time, offers, packages, partner with CPG brands as add on for packages, ask the right questions) 

3) Understand their background and speak their language (for this you need to know at least the basics of the biggest industries in your target market, for me are: finance, entrepreneurship, real state, tech, investing, ultra rich families, luxury) 

4) Confidence, there is a ton of people that can pay you right now $200-$5000 an hour but if you don’t have the confidence to charge that amount forget it. 

5) High end clientele recognize value in an instant but they also recognize bullshit even a faster, so know your shit! 

6) Is a game of numbers the more people you talk the more your chances of locking a client are. 

7) Dress/present accordingly, don’t mean wear Gucci to a client but invest in high and good looking quality clothes, but if you already have point 1 lock down then disregard this point because it means you already receive free clothes from multiple brands. ;)

8) Make content according to your niche and who you are as a trainer, the video is fine by whatever you focused on the video target that audience. (Want to grow booty with me show women growing booty, want to become more athletic show people training in their athletic development, etc)!

9) Testimonials are big, get a few friends and family and ask them to help you with testimonials then do the same once you have real clients results.

10) Never fucking stop, have fun
