Sonderform[ japanischer Dichtung](<Japan, Kunst#Poesie>).

In [Zen](Zen) tradition, one of the ways in which a Zen master may choose to die is to write a death poem

"From one basin to another, stuff and nonsense" -- Issa

"This must be my birthday, there in paradise" -- Joseki

"Though I should life to be a hundred, the same world, the same cherry blossoms" -- Taijju

"My old body, a drop of dew draw heavy at the leaftip" -- Kiba

"Emptyhanded I entered the world, barefoot I leave it, my coming, my going, two simple happenings that got entangled" -- Kozan Ichikyo (1283–1360)

"Till now I thought that death befell the untalented alone. If those with talent too must die, sure they make a better manure.

Oh young folk –
if you fear death,
die now!
Having died once
you won't die again.

-- [Hakuin Ekaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku) (白隠 慧鶴; 1685–1768)

"Bury me when I die under a wine barrel in a tavern. With luck the cask will leak." -- Moriya Sen'an (d. 1838) (The final line, "hopefully the cask will leak" (*mori ya sen nan)*, is a play on the poet's name, Moriya Sen'an.)

Death poems
are mere delusion –
death is death.

   -- Tokō (1710-1795)
