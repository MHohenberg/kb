The Mayan Theatre, at 1040 S. Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles, opened for live shows, in particular, musical comedies, on August 15, 1927 with the stage musical “Oh Kay!” starring Elsie Janis. Carved stone serpent heads, seven warrior figures in full head-dress (each representing the god of war, each used to light up after dark!) and celestial symbols and hieroglyphics were designed by artist Francisco Cornejo to ornament the structure designed by architects Morgan, Walls and Clements. That architectural firm also designed the exteriors of both the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and of the Wiltern Theatre.

Inside every square inch, decor is fantastical Mayan Revival, from the floor paving to the furniture and fixtures. The entry lobby is a hall of Inscriptions and is coated with hieroglyphics. The foyer is the Hall of Feathered Serpents. In the 1,491-seat auditorium, the huge central, polychromed plaster and metal chandelier is a replica of an Aztec calendar stone. The original painted fire safety curtain depicted Mayan jungles and temples, which completed the decorative scheme of the theatre.

The Mayan Theatre was a legitimate theatre for its first two years. Then from September 5, 1929 it went over to first run movies, opening with the World Premiere of Marion Davies in “Marianne”. It later showed second run movies. In the 1940’s, the theatre was a burlesque house and it is rumored that in 1948 a young [[Marilyn Monroe]] appeared here. By the end of the decade it tried arthouse films. From March 3rd 1950, the Mayan Theatre was the crown jewel of [[Francisco Fouce]]’s chain of Mexican film venues and the first presentation was - ‘Direct from Buenos Aires’ one of Latin America’s biggest stars Libertad Lamarque, ‘live on stage and on the screen’.

The theatre became a 3-screen adult porn theatre on March 14, 1969 (some of the films were shot in the basement of the theatre). It had been renamed Mayan 21 Theatre with the screens name A, B & C. Screens A & B screened ‘straight’ adult movies and Screen C screened gay male adult movies.

The auditorium has now been de-tripled and the current nightclub use, replete with the theatre’s original exotic Mayan interior, opened February 1990 and renamed The Mayan.

Showcasing the theatre itself, including its exotic interior, are movies filmed in the theatre, including the murder mystery, set in a theatre;Reginald Denny in “It Couldn’t Have Happened-But It Did” (1936), “Save the Tiger” with Jack Lemmon (1973) and “The Bodyguard” with Kevin Costner (1992). Gorgeous photographs of its auditorium, and of the next door Belasco Theatre auditorium, are in the 1997 book ‘The Last Remaining Seats, Movie Palaces of Tinseltown’.

The Mayan Theatre is designated a Historic Cultural Monument.
