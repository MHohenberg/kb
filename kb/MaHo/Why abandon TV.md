The Tv feeds people propaganda. In the early 1900s, the nephew of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Edward Bernays]], came up with a manual for mass manipulation. They began campaigns to manipulate people using the techniques they discovered. The first such campaign was the woman's liberation movement [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom)

This knowledge of mass manipulation was sold to advertisers who used it to manipulate people for the purpose of capitalism. The government used this manipulation for the purpose of enlistment into the armed services and for the manipulation of its citizens to go along with its narratives.

Tv produces a frequency which is said to lull the mind to sleep to allow the television propaganda to enter your subconscious. 

The "[4 Arguments for the Elimination of Television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Arguments_for_the_Elimination_of_Television)" is a book that was written in the 1970s by a man named [[Jerry Mander]] who was in the advertising industry for 15 years and was the president of an advertising company for 5 years. 

The 4 Arguments 

- It affects your mind, your senses, your knowledge and lends itself towards autocracy and propaganda.

- It programs your mind and the way you think. It makes you subservient and easier to control. It is a tool for mind control.

- The light from the tv can make people sick, causing mental issues like schizophrenia and subconscious hypnosis. The way tv shows and movies are edited also affects people's attention spans. 

- Bias is created by the tv. The viewer becomes indoctrinated. 

I read this book when I was fairly young and it had a profound effect on my psyche. I wrote previously about how I broke my indoctrination and this was a major key. I stopped watching tv completely and I still don't watch it to this day. I recommend this book to everyone.
