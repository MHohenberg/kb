The dream was in the early morning hours. 

The dream is about a role-playing game. In the setting of the dream, there is a man, a music teacher who is in love with his female student. When she refuses his advances, he - and the player who controls her - tries to fin creative ways of punishing her. Those include, among others, on.a curse that she may get stabbed in the back, one that make her a magnet for daddy-longleg-spiders (with a variant that makes them have nail-like legs that pierce the skin and then break off), and others. The music teacher goes so far as to try a few of those on himself. 

This all is being seen by another player, who controls another young woman. The other player discourages such behaviours, and so does her character. 

Ultimately, the game continues, and indeed the noblewoman gets cursed, and she knows who is responsible, searching her wannabe lover = she ultimately finds him in his own, now wealthy, manison, where the house staff try to refuse her any further information. Ultimately, she manages to - cloaked - ask for singing voice lessons directly, but the teacher refuses her until he recognizes her. Hoping for a reconsilation, he agrees ... the dream ends here, but I am aware that his wishes will not get fulfilled.
