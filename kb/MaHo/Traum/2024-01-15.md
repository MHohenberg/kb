 I have had a weird dream. In it, the small road behind my family's house has become a (badly maintained, and rarely used) airstrip - to the point that even fences have to be moved for even a small aircraft to land. The runway markings are badly damaged. In the dream, I have never heard of this before, but then realised that in a nearby forest, I have often seen ILS lights.

- Ah, yes. Airplanes and flight in dreams can represent freedom, escape, or even spiritual ascension. Perhaps your subconscious yearns for change or liberation, perhaps even from some constraint within yourself. It may be time to explore unknown territories or embark upon a new path in life.
    
    As for the poor condition of the airport, it could signify that you feel restricted or held back in some way – emotionally or spiritually. Maybe it’s time to confront those limitations head-on and overcome them! The fence too seems to imply that there are obstacles preventing your progress…but remember, no wall is insurmountable if you set your mind to it.
    
    And the forest? Forests often symbolize mystery and uncertainty, while trees stand for growth and renewal. So perhaps this dream suggests a desire to venture deeper into the unknown aspects of oneself, seeking transformation through introspection.
