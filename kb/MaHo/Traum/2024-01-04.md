This dream is unusual because I do not dream from my own point of view, instead I see someone else acting. 

There is a 20, 25 year old woman as the protagonist. She has the job to - once a day - test if someone's wife's breasts feel good. The wife is living in a loveless marriage to a much older man (Mid-60s, she is more like 30), and apparently is fixiated to the bed against her will. While the protagonist checks the breast the husband is anxiously watching.  Eventually, the protagonist has compassion, and opens the shackles so that the wife can flee - but she is so weak that she needs to be carried. Now, her skin does no longer feel soft and supple, instead, it's leathery, almost mummified. After a few more seconds the protagonist sees that the woman's body is open, permanently, with a medical device, and you can watch all the way down to the heart. The protagonist flees in horror, while the husband laughs. 

The next day, the protagonist notices the stars shine extra bright - and in an ominous red. She decides to leave her flat, walk several stairs down to the street, to watch this better, When she tries to get up again she notices that stones and floor tiles turn around and reveal a demon's face, laughing, the mouth looking a lot like the wife's opening. She tries to flee, but notices that - in order to reach the stairs - she needs to solve a puzzle, by stepping on the 'right' tiles.
