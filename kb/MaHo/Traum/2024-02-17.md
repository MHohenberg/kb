This is a dream set in the universe of Star Trek. 
First scene - this one is fictional, and I watch it with friends: They beam down somewhere and find what appears to be a feral feline-type humanoid wearing the remnants of a DS-era uniform. They overpower her, and take her back to their ship.
Second scene - this one I feel like was not a tv scene - a few years later, Troi and Worf scan another mineshaft, and find two more simlar people - an unnamed crewman, and what appears to be one of Troi's ancestors.  after the DS-people decide they can rust DS - and lead them to some sort of makeshift sickbay, where still others lay. One of them is DS-era Troi's son, who is initially distrustful of TNG-Era Troy ("Where are these people taking us?"), but is convinced by his mother ("To the future. They don't have pixels"). They arrive at some stairwell, which is exhausting to DS-Troy but she puls herself together and takes the first step, with the others following her. Eventually, she breaks down on the stairs, but not before thus saving the others. Worf comes up, carrying the people from sickbay, and nods approvingly. (Worf: To try and save 10 people is good. But to try to save 10, and end up saving 12, that is a success")
