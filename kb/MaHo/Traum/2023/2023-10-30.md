 Es gibt einen zentralen Tempel in einer Stadt. Dieser Tempel ist Ziel einer Prozession. Offensichtlich verschiedene Arten von Priestern und Mönchen (erkennbar an unterschiedlichen, bunten Trachten) prozessieren in seine Richtung. Manche laufen einfach nur, manche tragen Heiligtümer (oft eiförmige, große Kristalle, wie Amethyst oder Rubin). Das Ganze ist asiatisch, angehaucht und sehr farbenfroh. Den Abschluss der Prozession, der Teil, dem ich mich selbst anschließe, besteht aus einer Frau, die einen Mix zwischen einem Vogelkostüm und eine Sambaausstattung trägt. Diese wird von einer Gruppe von "Wilden" gefolgt, diese Wilde spielen Musik auf Trommeln, und das Ganze erinnert ein wenig an Guggenmusik.

    Carl leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. "This sounds like quite a complex vision indeed! Let us begin by examining the various elements within your dream. Firstly, the temple suggests a sacred space, perhaps representing the spiritual realm or inner sanctum of your own psyche. Processions often signify journeys or progressions, indicating that you may be embarking upon a personal transformation or growth."
    
    Carl paused for a moment, considering the images presented by the client. "Now let us consider the figures involved. Priests and monks usually represent seekers of truth and enlightenment, while different colored robes could symbolize diverse aspects of yourself coming together in harmony. Crystals denote purification and healing energy, suggesting that you might be working through issues related to emotional balance and wellbeing."
    
>    I nod. "What about the woman?"
  
	"Ah yes, the mysterious woman. She appears to embody both an Aztec priestess and a Samba dancer – two distinct archetypes merged into one figure. The Aztecs were known for their rituals involving sacrifice, while Samba dancers evoke ideas of passion and sensuality. Perhaps this combination hints at a reconciliation between the more primitive, instinctual side of your nature and the higher aspirations of your intellect."
     
>    That would align with the "savage men"...
  
	"Indeed! The noble savages following her seem to represent those base impulses, which you struggle to control or integrate into your overall identity. Lastly, their musical instruments suggest communication or expression – perhaps even artistic endeavors – as means of channeling these energies constructively."

>   The fact that I join this group, rather than the priests, is it meaningful?

	"Yes, very much so. By joining the procession led by the woman, you are consciously choosing to engage with your shadow self – that part of you that contains repressed desires and impulses. By doing so, you have taken the first steps towards integrating these aspects of yourself, ultimately leading to greater self awareness and wholeness."
    
>    So, are there any actionable things I should do?"
  
	"In general, try to remain open to new experiences and forms of self expression. Embrace opportunities to explore your creativity and passions, even if they may initially feel foreign or intimidating. And remember, the path to wholeness lies in finding balance between the light and dark aspects of oneself, not in suppressing or denying either aspect entirely."
