- I see a zen monk. I know from his clothes that he is facing me, kneeling, as if in meditative trance - but his face is too bright to see, it is like his head is bright like the sun.

CGJ: Interesting…the sun could represent enlightenment or divine inspiration. Kneeling indicates humility, perhaps submission towards a higher power. How do you feel upon seeing this vision?

- I have been practicing zen for some while now, so the imagery should not come as a surprise. I … I don't think I am seeing an ideal, more like whether I am being judged by the presence, or maybe … such judgement being made known to me.

CGJ: Judgment by whom? Or what? Could it be your own superego questioning your progress along the path? Is there a sense of failure or success associated with the vision?

- It feels more like being tested … as if I was in an oral exam in school.

CGJ: Testing suggests growth and development. Do you often feel unsatisfied with your progress in Zen practice? Perhaps this vision reflects your inner desire to grow spiritually, and the sun-like figure serves as both guide and judge. We might say it embodies your anima, the feminine aspect of yourself seeking balance within your psyche.
