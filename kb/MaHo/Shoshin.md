Shoshin is the Japanese [[Zen]] term for a "beginner's mind' and refers to a
paradox: The more knowledge you have on a subject, the more likely you are to
close your mind to further learning. 

- Having an academic degree in a subject can lead people to overestimate their
  knowledge. Studies showed that graduate participants frequently
  overestimated their level of understanding.  

- Even feeling like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. Research also
  showed that giving people the impression that they were relatively expert on
  a topic led them to be less willing to consider other viewpoints.  

- Deliberately invoking the emotion of awe quietens the ego. It also creates
  a greater willingness to look at things differently while recognizing the gaps
  in one's knowledge. 

- Invoking the emotions of awe and wonder, such as looking at the aurora
  borealis, also reduces the need to be satisfied by closed arguments.
