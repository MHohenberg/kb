[[Leviathan]] (in Job 41) is described almost the same as [[Yahewh]] (Jehovah) in Psalms 18:8, suggesting a connection.

Yahweh (Jehovah) is described in Psalms by the words:

**_“Smoke pours from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds. Its breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from its mouth”._**

While Leviathan in Job is described by the words:

**_“Smoke poured from his nostrils; fierce flames leaped from his mouth. Glowing coals blazed forth from him”._** 

Scholar Georges Dumézil has shown that the name Kronos (Latin Saturn) derives from the same root as the Russian vqan, chran, meaning whale or leviathan, and indeed in Greek mythology — Kronos devoured his children — just as the whale is known to swallow its prey into its enormous mouth.

[[Origen of Alexandria]], one of the greatest Christian theologians, connects the Demiurge Ialdabaoth with “[[Phainon]]” which is the old name for the planet Saturn. The American anthropologist [[Bethe Hagens]] says: “The Demiurge can be interpreted as the planet Saturn, giver of measure and time”. 

Leviathan, Saturn, Jehovah, all appear linked. The 19th-century occultist Alice Bailey tells us: “Saturn, Shiva, and Jehovah are one”.
