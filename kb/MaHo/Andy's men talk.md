“Andy’s Men Talk” is a podcast and media platform that focuses on men’s mental health, well-being, and personal development. Created by Andy Fooks, the platform provides a space for discussions on a wide range of topics relevant to men’s lives, such as emotional expression, relationships, mental health challenges, and societal expectations of masculinity.

The podcast often features guests from various backgrounds, including mental health professionals, athletes, and other public figures, who share their experiences and insights. The goal is to foster open conversations about issues that men may typically find difficult to discuss, aiming to break down stigmas and encourage men to seek support and care for their mental and emotional well-being.
