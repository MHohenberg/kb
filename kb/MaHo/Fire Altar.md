In the twilight's eerie glow,
A couple's love, a fateful show,
With hearts entwined, they chose their fate,
To prove their bond, they would not wait.
A fire altar, burning bright,
Set the stage for their last night,
With courage strong, they faced the end,
Hand in hand, as lover and friend.
The guillotine's shadow loomed,
A harbinger of love's sweet doom,
With heads held low, and hearts ablaze,
They met their fate, in love's embrace.
The rope released, the iron fell,
A final breath, a silent knell,
Their severed heads, a somber sight,
Rolled into the fire's light.
In flames, they danced as souls took flight,
A tragic tale of love's fierce might,
For in that moment, they transcended,
Two hearts as one, forever blended
