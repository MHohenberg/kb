1. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)**
    
    - **How to Calculate**: Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity
    - **Healthy Values**: A lower ratio (e.g., less than 1) is generally seen as healthy, indicating the company is not overly reliant on debt. However, this can vary by industry.
      
2. **Current Ratio**
    
    - **How to Calculate**: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    - **Healthy Values**: A ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than liabilities, suggesting good short-term financial health. A ratio well above 1 (e.g., 1.5 or 2) is often seen as healthy.
      
3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**
    
    - **How to Calculate**: Net Income / Total Assets
    - **Healthy Values**: This varies by industry, but generally, a higher percentage means the company is using its assets efficiently to generate profits. For airlines, a value of 3-5% might be considered healthy due to the capital-intensive nature of the industry.
      
4. **Interest Coverage Ratio**
    
    - **How to Calculate**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense
    - **Healthy Values**: A ratio above 1.5 is generally considered good, indicating the company can comfortably cover its interest payments. Higher is better.
