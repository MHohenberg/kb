## The universe is mental
* Distractions are taking away your ability to create your own world. When energy flows where attention goes, anything that grabs your attention becomes basically an [[energy vampire]], deliberately or not. See the zombie-like gamblers sitting in front of Las Vegas' one-armed bandits, mindlessly stuffing it with coins, not even able to enjoy the ocassional win. 
* We see this over and over in religions, especially those who focus on faith like [[Christentum|Christianity]]: We need to *believe*, and God/the Universe will *answer*. Unfortunately, many religious dogmas stop there ... they see this as a transactional thing with a deity, when it appears to me right now to be more a karmic cause-and-effect thing. 
* When the universe is mental, and not physical, this plays into the buddhist/hindu concept of [[Maja]]
* If the universe is mental, outcome ultimately is pointless: As actors, not all of our masks will receive a happy ending - but in the big picture, that's ok. 

## As above so below. As within so without
* This is not only a description of a state, showing how the universe works - it also is an invitation to change the big by changing the small things. My life falling apart is a big thing, but my flat being chaos is a small thing, and the small thing I can change. In that understanding, the [petersonesque][Jordan Peterson] 'clean up your room' gets a new meaning (and did not your father tell you, decades ago, that your environment is a representation of your mind?)
