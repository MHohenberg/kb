Innere [[Alchemie]], insbesondere in der [[TCM]] und im [[Daoismus]].

Internal alchemy focuses upon transforming the bodily _sanbao_ "three treasures", which are the essential energies sustaining human life: 

- _[Jing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing_(TCM) "Jing (TCM)")_ [精](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B2%BE#Chinese "wikt:精") "nutritive essence, essence; refined, perfected; extract; soul, dark, animal instincts,demon; sperm, ovum,seed, Genetics", referring to the primordial energies of the physical body. Based upon the idea that death and illness are caused by over straining and stressing of one's mind and body leads to the depletion of one's _jing_, Daoist internal alchemy claimes that preserving _jing_ allowes one to have a long, healthy and happy life, known classically as longevity in Chinese thought, if not [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality "Immortality")
- _[Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi "Qi")_ [氣](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B0%A3#Chinese "wikt:氣") "acquired energy air food water vital energy, grey, force; air, vapour; breath; vigor; attitude", defined as the "natural energy of the universe" and manifests in everyone and everything. By means of internal alchemy, Taoists strive to maintain a positive free flow of _qi_ through the body in paths or [meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine) "Meridian (Chinese medicine)") moving to each individual organ.as Stagnation of qi is a primary or root cause of many health conditions in traditional Chinese thinking.Healing practices such as [acupuncture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture "Acupuncture"), [Tui na](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_na "Tui na"), [cupping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy "Cupping therapy") and [herbal medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology "Chinese herbology") are believed to open up the _qi_ [meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine) "Meridian (Chinese medicine)") throughout the body so that the _qi_can flow freely. Keeping _qi_ in balance and flowing throughout the body promotes health; imbalance can lead to sickness.
- _[Shen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_(Chinese_religion) "Shen (Chinese religion)")_ [神](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E#Chinese "wikt:神") "spirit; mind, glow, bright ; god, deity; vitality supernatural abilities, higher intentions, supernatural being" _Shen_ is the original spirit of the body. To have good Shen is to look vital and glowing on the surface of the skin and the gloss and spark seen in the eyes. It is the hue on the leaf of a tree. Taoists try to become conscious of _shen_ through contemplative practices, including meditation.

According to the 13th-century _[Book of Balance and Harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Balance_and_Harmony "The Book of Balance and Harmony")_:

Making one's essence complete, one can preserve the body. To do so, first keep the body at ease, and make sure there are no desires. Thereby energy can be made complete.

Making one's energy complete, one can nurture the mind. To do so, first keep the mind pure, and make sure there are no thoughts. Thereby spirit can be made complete.

Making one's spirit complete, one can recover emptiness. To do so, first keep the will sincere, and make sure body and mind are united. Thereby spirit can be returned to emptiness. ... To attain immortality, there is nothing else but the refinement of these three treasures: essence, energy, spirit."
