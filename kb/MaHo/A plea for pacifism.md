## War is inheriently immoral

If we agree life (or even just human life) is the highest good, to be protected at all costs, then anything that destroys life is the ultimate evil.

## Pacifism - and appeasement

One thing a pacifist gets accused a lot today is being an appeaser, a modern Chamberlain, that if we do not stop some real or imagined next Hitler, that dictator will keep stomping around on his inevitable way to world domination. Such an accusation of appeasement often comes from the bellicist, the one who wants an escalation of a conflict - of course, without their personal involvement. 

We need to understand the mind of the hawk to see his point of view. And we need to explore where these ideas come from. 

The idea of an ultimate evil that needs to be destroyed is a romantic propagandist idea. We find it in any war, but - given most contemporaries never were involved in one - we see it in media. Star Wars - a thinly veiled WW2 fantasy epic - has the Emperor. Countless kids cartoons feature good-vs-evil stories, with evil often being the dictator on the verge of world domination. And then, of course, there are the countless WW2 documentaries which focus on how awful the enemy was (making it a ‘just cause’), and mythically inflates the strength of enemy resolve, forces, wicked inventiveness or plans. 
### A pacifist is not necessarily passive
Being pacifist does not mean to be a lamb standing on a meadow waiting for slaughter - the pacifist *can* still influence the world around him. He *can* put on economic pressure. He *can* convince people to change their ways by means of culture. And he *can* choose to support an opposition. What a principled pacifist does not do is to reach for the rifle as anything but a measure of last resort - an absolute pacifist would not do so at all.

## Propaganda
The goal of the propagandist is to influence public opinion so that an action - or inaction - finds public support. In the case of conflict, propaganda is meant to increase the willingness for military spending and/or entering into a war. 

Propagandists achieve this by three major talking points:
1. The enemy is irrational and cannot be reasoned with. Thus they are ‘mad dogs’ that need to be put down. This takes away critical thought, beginning with „what are the causes of this conflict, what are the goals of the ‘enemy’“). this comes in two subvariants:
	1. Invoking the demons of the past. Their leader almost always is ‘the new Hitler’. This superimposes a known evil over - a political leadership whose actions may not warrant such a comparison - and immediately makes it clear: nothing but a 1945-style complete surrender and replacement of their leadership is acceptable. Ironically this *increases* the duration of the war because it takes the „safe way out“ for the opposing side away - they now fight for their very survival. 
	2. The common enemy soldier is subhuman. They are monsters, apes, rats, or - more recently - orcs. They only know violence, their only joy in life is to cause suffering. This makes killing them easier, and removes any compassion they might otherwise receive. „If they did not support the war, they would not fight it, or commit suicide the moment they got a firearm“ - the armchair general will say, ignoring that conscriptions and drafts do exist.
2. The enemy is relentlessly expansionist and strong enough to continue their assault indefinitely. Once they have achieved their current goals, they will pick the next target - and eventually *you*. This creates urgency (‘take them out before they come here’)
3. **The enemy is monstrously cruel.** Stories of atrocities - especially against civilians, and with particular focus on women, children, and the elderly - are amplified. These accounts often include sexual violence, abductions, or torture, provoking fear for one’s own family and igniting moral outrage.

Propagandists work in mottos: This ranges from „Orcs must die“ of the Russo-Ukrainian War to the German „Jeder Schuss ein Russ, jeder Stoß ein Franzos’“ of World War 1. Much like in advertisements, mottos are short, get into people’s minds, and eventually are mindlessly repeated, not only changing the thinking of an individual, but memetically infecting others.
