# Things I have learned during the CARDS project

## It is easy to overcomplicate things

At first, I thought I would need soe suction cup, pneumatic system to pick up individual cards for moving around.  I imagined, and ordered, tubes, and suction cups, vacuum generators and pressure valves ... adding severely more complexity to the project, with more moving parts, more electric needed, and more general single point of failures. 

Turns out I did not understand the measurement system of pneumatic robotics, so I ordered a lot of parts wrong, in the wrong size, in the wrong tube diameter ... that did cost time, and money, and looked a bit like this:

Eventually, I looked at my storage of discarded electrics, and found this: 

It's a pump for removing the air in clothing luggage bags, to minimize volume for more efficient packing. I bought it 4 years ago, never used it. It's a part you can buy for about 5 Euros. 

After some ... modification, it looks like this, and it works just fine:

Lesson learned: First, look at what you have. Do not fall into the trap of wanting to use unknown technology just because you saw something on a talk or a youtube video one day. 

## Before getting started, make sure to have enough small hardware around

Screws, T-Nuts

## Be organized in the small things

You'll always find the 70 cm 20x20 Aluminium extrusion - but good luck finding the M4x8 screw you knew you had prepared.

## Have a reliable, local supplier

Tried to get a lot of things from AliExpress ... but for small, relatively cheap stuff, go local. Having to wait 2 weeks for some T-nuts that turn out to be M4 instead of M5 - just to then waiting some more time to get M4 screws is frustrating.

## ... but do not rely on local stores

We have a notable number of DIY and hardware stores around. Some are the size of small airport terminals. At the start of the project, I wished to source locally. One store had 60 meters of shelf space dedicated to screws. I live in an area in which the richest guy - a multibillionaire - made his fortune selling screws. Guess what I can't get in a store around here? Simple ISO XXXX M5x8 lentil-headed hexagonal screws (also none using the philips cross or Torx). Also: no Aluminium extrudes - only Aluminium profiles, which lack the grooves, and are much thinner. 

I am still a friend to get locally what you can get locally. But do not rely on them for parts you are not absolutely, 100% positive they carry. 

Do not rely on the sales personnel to even speak your language: Asking for a 2040 v-rail aluminium extrusion only produced big question marks over their heads. This arguably is a problem mostly related to larger, corporate stores which hire minimum wage store personnel - one of the many reasons I prefer smaller stores. Also, from experience, I had more luck getting good, useful stuff from hardware stores geared less towards the home improvement people and more towards farmers. 

## Make sure you have the right tools for the trade

I need a small CNC machine to mill some Aluminium parts - mostly connectors and mechanical stuff where plastic may give too much play.
