# Tribal Knowledge

Tribal knowledge, also known as "knowledge silos," refers to information and expertise that is held by a specific group or team within an organization, and is not easily accessible or shared with others. This can lead to inefficiencies and hinder the overall success of a team or organization. In order to avoid tribal knowledge, it is important to establish processes and tools for sharing information and knowledge within a team. One such tool that can be useful in this regard is Atlassian Confluence.

Confluence is a collaboration and documentation platform that allows teams to create, share, and organize information in a central location. By using Confluence, teams can easily share information and knowledge, and ensure that important information is not lost or forgotten when team members move on.

One key feature of Confluence is the ability to create and share documents and wikis. These can be used to document important information and processes, such as best practices, procedures, and guidelines. By having a central location where this information is stored and easily accessible, team members can stay up-to-date on important information, and new team members can quickly get up to speed.

Another feature of Confluence is the ability to create and manage projects. This allows teams to organize their work and share progress, and provides a centralized location for all project-related information. This can help to ensure that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same goals.

To encourage the use of Confluence, it is important to establish clear guidelines for how it should be used within the team. This can include things like what types of information should be documented, who should have access to certain information, and how often information should be updated. It's also important to provide training and support to team members to ensure they know how to use the platform and can take full advantage of its features.

In addition, it's also important to make sure that everyone on the team knows that they are responsible for sharing and contributing information to Confluence. Encourage everyone to share their knowledge and best practices, and to use Confluence as a tool for collaborating and problem-solving.

In conclusion, tribal knowledge can be a major hindrance to the success of a team or organization. By using a tool like Atlassian Confluence, teams can establish processes and tools for sharing information and knowledge. By establishing guidelines, providing training and support, encouraging everyone to share information and contribute, and making sure everyone is on the same page with the same goals, teams can avoid tribal knowledge and achieve better results.
