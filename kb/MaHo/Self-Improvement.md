## High-Value man

1. Remove crutches. Body, status, money, girls are just crutches. It is a deep internal feeling to have to be a hv. 
2. Reimagine the timeline: This takes time. 5 years minimum. You need to fully integrate into the role.
3. Have ultimate, true freedom:
   1. financial freedom
   2. location freedom
   3. time freedom
4. Some sort of adversity (you grow with these things)
5. A strong network

# Prayer

Talk from your heart to His. As if you two were having a conversation.

Tell Him what you need, what’s bothering you, what your fears are.

Talk to God the Father like He is your parent, then talk to Jesus like He is your closest friend.

Be honest. Be vulnerable.

The Lord wants to hear everything from you, good and bad. You can tell Him anything, and he will listen patiently and be there for you.

It may take days, weeks or even years for us to understand God’s response, but He always answers.

# Brain Fog

Hydrate properly, cold shower 2 to 3 mins, cardio exercise, fresh air/sunshine, L-theanine, cbd, omega 3's, cut down on processed food and chemicals such as food dyes, gluten and things that come packaged.

## Trapped

Most men live a life of quiet desperation.

Why? Bills and Commitment!

Change: Put away money to have a window, have a plan, then work on your escape, and fight for it.

Come to the realisation: you became stuck, you fucked up.



## Catalysts

People change in four different seasons. 

1. When they are hurt enough that they have to. 
2. When they see enough, that it truly inspires them to change. 
3. When they learn enough that they want to. 
4. When they receive enough that they are able to.
