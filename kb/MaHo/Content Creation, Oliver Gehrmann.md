My 28-Day LinkedIn Experiment - The Results

Initial Plan:
- 3 posts per week, no specific strategy.
- Aimed to share snippets and interesting nuggets from my daily life.
- Explored various content formats to determine what resonated and felt authentic.

Outcome:
- 34.9K Impressions & 270 Engagements
- 200 new followers (Hi 👋🏼)
- And, unexpectedly, one genuine project opportunity!

What Worked Best:
1. Selfies
2. Swear words
3. Controversial claims
(After all, we're all human, right? 😆)

Learnings:
- Not every post will go viral, and that's ok. (Though it's a bit sad when a post you've spent 1.5 hours on gets only 5 reactions.)
- Consistency is key. Content creation is a journey, not just a one-time thing.
- Brainstorming post ideas came naturally. I set aside time for weekly reflections, prepared content on Sundays, and scheduled them ahead.
- Writing these posts was primarily enlightening for me. The process of condensing thoughts often brings about deeper understanding.
- Interacting with fellow experts in the comments has been fun.
- The kindness from everyone has been amazing. No bad vibes, just lots of thanks.
- A quick note: Reach is about offering value, not just showcasing oneself.

What's Next?
- Evaluating the time investment versus benefits, this experiment feels worth it. I've allocated about 2-3 hours each week for content creation
- As posting has become more enjoyable and feels more "natural", I'll continue with the 3 posts per week rhythm.
- My future content will touch upon IT Compliance, insights from my entrepreneurial journey, and interesting discoveries I stumble upon.

Have a topic in mind you're curious about? Leave a comment, and I'll try to address it in upcoming posts! 😊
