### Not becoming a bridezilla: How to deal with performance anxiety without lashing out.
Weddings are often described as one of the happiest days of a person’s life. However, the journey to that perfect day can be fraught with stress, anxiety, and the overwhelming pressure to ensure everything is flawless. This pressure can sometimes transform even the most level-headed bride into a “bridezilla”—a term used to describe a bride who becomes excessively demanding and difficult to deal with. This chapter aims to help you manage performance anxiety and maintain your composure, ensuring you enjoy the planning process and preserve your relationships.

**Understanding Performance Anxiety**

Performance anxiety is the fear of not meeting expectations, whether they are your own or those of others. In the context of wedding planning, this can manifest as a fear of disappointing guests, failing to achieve your dream wedding, or encountering unforeseen mishaps. Recognizing that it’s natural to feel anxious about such a significant event is the first step in managing it effectively.

**Strategies to Prevent Bridezilla Moments**

1. **Set Realistic Expectations:**

• Understand that perfection is an illusion. No wedding is without minor hiccups, and that’s okay.

• Focus on the big picture—what truly matters is the celebration of your love, not every minute detail.

2. **Delegate Tasks:**

• Trust your wedding planner and your bridal party to handle responsibilities.

• Delegating tasks not only eases your workload but also makes others feel involved and appreciated.

3. **Prioritize Self-Care:**

• Make time for relaxation and activities that calm you, such as yoga, meditation, or a spa day.

• Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated.

4. **Communicate Effectively:**

• Express your concerns and anxieties to your partner, family, and friends.

• Open communication helps prevent misunderstandings and allows others to support you.

5. **Set Boundaries:**

• It’s important to set boundaries with well-meaning family members or friends who might add to your stress.

• Politely but firmly assert your needs and preferences.

6. **Practice Mindfulness:**

• Stay present and focus on enjoying each moment of the planning process.

• Techniques such as deep breathing exercises can help you stay grounded.

7. **Create a Contingency Plan:**

• Accept that some things may not go as planned. Have backup plans for critical aspects like weather or vendor issues.

• Knowing you have a plan B can significantly reduce anxiety.

**Managing Conflict and Emotions**

1. **Recognize Triggers:**

• Identify what specific aspects of planning cause you the most stress.

• Being aware of triggers allows you to prepare and manage them better.

2. **Stay Positive:**

• Focus on positive affirmations and visualize a successful, joyful wedding day.

• Remind yourself why you are doing this—to celebrate your love and commitment.

3. **Seek Professional Help if Needed:**

• Don’t hesitate to talk to a therapist or counselor if you find yourself overwhelmed.

• Professional guidance can provide strategies for managing stress and maintaining healthy relationships.

4. **Apologize and Rebuild:**

• If you do have a bridezilla moment, don’t hesitate to apologize to those affected.

• Show appreciation for their support and understanding, and work on rebuilding any strained relationships.

**Conclusion**

Remember, your wedding is a celebration of love and unity, not a test of your perfectionism. By recognizing and managing your performance anxiety, you can navigate the planning process with grace and joy. Embrace the journey, cherish the moments, and let your wedding be a testament to your love, resilience, and the bonds you share with those around you.
