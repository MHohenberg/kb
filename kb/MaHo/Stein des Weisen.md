"The central conception of alchemy is the conception of the philosopher’s stone. What is it? It’s the universal panacea at the end of time. It’s the chocolate cake that your mother made once a week when you were a child. It is the **pana supersubstantialis**. It’s all things to all men and all women. If you’re hungry, you eat it. If you’re dirty, you shower under it. If you need to go somewhere, you sit on it and you fly there. If you have a question, it answers it. It’s something that the human mind senses in itself and is related to, invoked and worshiped over centuries, before the slow rise of the patriarchy, rationalism and materialism turned it into a myth and a fairy tale."

Alchemical gold, in short this is what we're after. If you possess it, nothing else is worth anything because it is psychic completion, peace of mind, [Jung](<Carl Gustav Jung>) called it the self. It's the self that we are trying to recover, and remember we talked about the Gnostic myth of the light trapped in matter. Well, this is the **luminae** **de** **luminae**, the light of light, the lux **natura**, the light drawn out of nature and condensed into a fixed form which then becomes the universal panacea. And I'm using as many of these alchemical terms as I can draw out of my memory to give you a feeling for it. This is the universal medicine. It cures all ills, you know, it brings you riches, fame, wealth, self-respect. It's the answer, it's what everyone is looking for and no one can find."
