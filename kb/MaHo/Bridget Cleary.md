Irische Frau, die 1895 von ihrem Mann nahe [[Clonmel]] (Irland) verbrannt wurde, der sie für einen [[Wechselbalg]] hielt. 

Following the death of Bridget's mother, the Clearys found themselves responsible for her elderly father, Patrick Boland. His residence with the couple enabled them to secure a house reserved for labourers. Neither Bridget nor Michael was entitled to this cottage, but as Patrick had been a labourer in his youth, they were able to acquire the best house in the village. However, there was no widespread interest in the house, as it was built on the site of a supposed [fairy ringfort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_fort "Fairy fort").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Bridget_Cleary#cite_note-google1-2)

Bridget was reported [missing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person "Missing person") in March 1895. She had evidently been ill for several days; her diagnosis was said to be [bronchitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis "Bronchitis"). More than a week into her illness, on 13 March 1895, a physician visited her at her home; her condition was considered sufficiently grave that a priest soon followed, to administer [last rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_rites "Last rites"). Several of Bridget's friends and family members attended her over the next two days, and a number of home remedies were administered, including one ritual that anticipated her later demise: her father and her husband accused her of being a [fairy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD "Aos Sí") sent to take Bridget's place. Urine was thrown on her, and she was carried before the fireplace to cast the fairy out.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Bridget_Cleary#cite_note-3)

By 16 March, rumours were beginning to circulate that Bridget was missing, and local police began searching for her. Michael was quoted as claiming that his wife had been taken by fairies, and he appeared to be holding a [vigil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil "Vigil"). Witness statements were gathered over the ensuing week, and by the time Bridget's burnt corpse was found in a shallow grave on 22 March, nine people had been charged in her disappearance, including her husband. A [coroner's inquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner%27s_inquest "Coroner's inquest") the next day returned a verdict of death by burning.
