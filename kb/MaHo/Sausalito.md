* Tiki Junction
    Well, *chuckles* the one that stands out the most immediately — there’s
    several. [[Barney West]] lived and worked at what he called Tiki Junction, and
    he was a chainsaw tiki god carver. *laughs* He made sculptures, and anybody who was in  Sausalito in those years would have known him, because they were right along  Bridgeway. I don’t remember exactly how I met him. I probably walked up and said, “Hello,” but I was looking for a place to live ’cause, gain, this was right after I graduated in ’62.

    So, there’s Barney in this crazy hat, and making these wild sculptures with
    a chainsaw. I’d never seen anything like that either, typical West Coast
    thing I suppose. Anyway, I kinda became friends with him, and he had a
    little boat and he had had built a little rickety dock out behind that, it
    was like a projection of that area. I’ve forgotten what it was called.
