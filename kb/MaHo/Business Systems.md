A *system* is a ‘machine to get results’

As any machine, it has four components:, it has 
1. inputs, 
2. a process, 
3. outputs,
4. feedback loop
	1. this can work with scorecards

Four Functions (these act as ‘categories’): 
1. Marketing -> Leads
2. Sales -> Clients
3. Ops -> Service
4. Finance -> Money
Functions have *goals* (e.g. Marketing -> Generate leads)

Now write all tasks you do. These tasks share the goal with the function they belong to.
