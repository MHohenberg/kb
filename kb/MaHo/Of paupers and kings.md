One of the throwaway phrases in any modern discussion about poverty is something along the lines of "paupers today living better than kings a couple of centuries ago". This is an incredibly shortsighted idea that melds together insignificant aspects and do not take quality of living into account. 

It is true that today has many amenities that were unavailable in the past (think plumbing, electricity, transportation, access to entertainment and education, advantages in modern medicine ...). And if you make the observation that a poor person today lives an almost magical life in the eyes of a poor person from a few centuries ago, you would have a point.

But then there are the comforts wealth can buy: good food. Sexual attention. Works of art. Fast horses. 

Would you rather live as a king in [Versailles](Versailles), ca. 1740, with 10 maitresses, a cook, someone to keep your home clean, and someone else keeping you reasonably safe, or poor in a 1960s-built cheap social housing block full of crime and grime today, living on off-brand mystery meat?
