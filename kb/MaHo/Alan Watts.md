# Familie

and the family branches were the Buchans, the Wattses — those were the two that I remember the best. I can’t remember my grandmother’s family’s descent, but that was the Buchan side.  And my father’s father was an executive for Michelin Tyre, worked in London, and his wife worked actually for a Baptist boarding school for the children of missionaries on their way  to China. So, Lawrence and Emily were a hardworking couple, and more than                 
anything they wanted something better for their son.

## Druid Heights, Konflikt mit Ed Stiles

1:53:09 Edmund Stiles:     Well, unfortunately, Alan has become Druid Heights in
                      everybody’s mind, which I regret because Alan was just
                      there for two, maybe two-and-a-half years before he
                      died.
			  
1:53:19 Debra Schwartz:   He died there, correct?

1:53:21 Edmund Stiles:      Yes, he died there. He died there in the house that I
                      built for Thea Gidlow. He lived and died in that
                      house. Roger lived and died in that house. That house
                      sort of became everybody’s departure point. [chuckles]
                      It’s hard for me to talk about Alan, because Alan and
                      I had an unhappy relationship. I don’t even like to
                      say it, but I had no other option. Alan wanted the house that I’d built for Thea. He got together with Elsa, and he wanted to live there. Thea was there, which was my intention: I gave the house to Thea and Elsa, gave them a life estate on it. I owned it. I built it; I owned it.
			  
1:54:10 Edmund Stiles:    Yeah. I’ll just say this much: Alan was going to build
                          a house there using Roger’s design skills, and Roger
                          was gonna build it. And Roger was so flamboyant. This
                          is my understanding of what happened. The house that
                          Roger designed for Alan on that site was way beyond
                          Alan’s ability to afford or anything like that. That
                          happened with a lot of Roger’s designs. They were just
                          too far out. They were amazing renderings. I loved
                          his flamboyance, but almost nobody could ever build
                          them. So Alan bailed, and that meant that Thea had to
                          leave, because Budd Isaacs, our down-the-hill
                          neighbor, had gotten Thea’s trailer condemned by the
                          county. I was new there. We had  been there maybe a
                          year when that happened, and I was outraged that this
                          guy would do that. 			  

1:55:03 Edmund Stiles:    Yes. And so the one thing that never occurred to me
                          was that Elsa would get rid of her own sister so that
                          Alan could have the place, and that’s what
                          happened. When I had the papers drawn up to give the
                          life estate to the two women, Thea and Elsa — Thea,
                          because it was her house, I built it for her, and Elsa
                          because she put up the land that it was on. So that
                          was our deal. She put up the land, I put up the
                          house. I  built it physically myself and it took
                          pretty much all of our resources and about two years
                          of my time. I was trying to make a living at the same
                          time, so it took a while. And when it was finally
                          done, Thea moved in and I think she was there for
                          about a year before Marilyn and I got away for a
                          weekend for the first time since our kids were
                          born. We’re gone for three days, and when we came back
                          Thea was gone and Alan was in the house. And I went,
                          “What the hell just happened?” And it turned out that
                          Alan had gone to Elsa and said, “Well, I really like
                          that little house that Ed built and I want it. And so
                          here’s the deal, I’ll give you a certain amount of
                          money, you move Thea out of there, and we’ll support
                          her in some other place” — with the money that he
                          would give Elsa. So Elsa sold her sister out, in my
                          opinion. I loved Elsa, but —  

1:56:18 Edmund Stiles:    They put her into some chicken shack up in Petaluma,
                          or what’s that other community near Petaluma? Never
                          mind, somewhere out in the countryside, and she lived
                          out her life there and died not very well, as a matter
                          of fact. So that was a violation of the trust of the
                          place, as far as I was concerned. That tore it for me
                          absolutely with Alan. I could never forgive him for
                          that. Instead of coming to me and saying, “Is there
                          any way we could work something out here?” he went to
                          Elsa and made a pact with Elsa, and Thea was gone,
                          fait accompli. And then he did it again later when he
                          wanted to build his library. I had a right of first
                          refusal on the land next to the library, because I’d
                          asked Elsa for that when I built the house, and the
                          reason I asked was that house was not a place I wanted
                          to live. It was built for Thea.  
  
1:57:14:                  And I thought, “Well, the real charm of the house is
                          its privacy and its setting, and I didn’t want
                          somebody to build something really stupid next to it.”
                          I’m sort of buggish about about that. So I had this
                          right of first refusal, which I didn’t really think
                          I’d ever exercise. I had no reason to, but at least it
                          gave me some option if somebody wanted to do something
                          stupid. Alan wanted to do something stupid, which was
                          that he wanted to build a really ugly white box for a
                          library in the woods, right next to the model house. I
                          was waiting for him to come and approach me to ask me
                          for the right of first refusal, and I would have given
                          it to him if he’d just come to me and said, “Hey, what
                          do you want for it?” I’d say, “It’s yours.” He never
                          did. And I’m still offended by that, to be honest.

1:57:58 Debra Schwartz:   Do you think his celebrity had something to do with
                          the sense of entitlement or was he just that kind of
                          guy, just forged ahead without thinking?    

1:58:06 Edmund Stiles:    I think that he had become paranoid and acquisitive in
                          a way.  I’ve been trying to understand him, actually,
                          all these years. I use him as my example of when good
                          people go bad. With that intellect, for him to become
                          that kind of son-of-a-bitch, I never understood it. I
                          couldn’t understand it. Of course, I was offended by
                          it  because all I wanted was for him to acknowledge me
                          as a human being and tell me what he wanted, and I
                          probably would have just given it to him. But he
                          didn’t wanna take that chance, so he used a legal
                          maneuver to get it out from underneath me. It didn’t
                          change the outcome. 
			  
** Tod

1:54:47 Debra Schwartz:    Is there a mystery around your father’s death?  
 
1:54:51 Mark Watts:        There is, and there were a lot of theories after it
                           happened. I mean, first of all my father died
                           suddenly. What was unconventional was that he was
                           very quickly cremated and the authorities were not at
                           all sure that he had just died a  natural death. And
                           I was blissfully unaware of this at the time. I only
                           became aware of it when people had said odd things
                           to me, and then one of the people who helped cremate
                           him, from this Buddhist sect, came up to me in a
                           bookstore and said, "It really bothered  me and I’ve
                           always been wanting to tell you this but the wood
                           that was used to cremate  your father was loaded into
                           the truck the day before he died, and not after he
                           died, before  he died." So, that got me on it.			   
 
1:55:49 Debra Schwartz:    The wood to — don’t you get usually cremated at a — 
 
1:55:52 Mark Watts:        He was cremated on Muir Beach at 8:30 in the morning
                           after being discovered deceased at 6:00 a.m. 
 
1:56:01 Debra Schwartz:    Who cremated him?  
 
1:56:02 Mark Watts:        [[Ajari]] and a group of [[Kailas Shugendō]], a
                           self-styled Buddhist sect. They used to wander the
                           Haight in a Dodge power wagon ambulance  painted
                           purple as an ambulance, and they would do this sort
                           of rescue Buddhist thing. They went to all the
                           festivals, like they were at [Altamonte][Altamont Free Concert] and places
                           like that. It’s funny because then there was then a
                           cover up that that wasn’t what happened, “Oh no, that
                           never happened.” It was crazy. And so, I think there
                           were two suspects. One was that my stepmother had
                           taken his life, fearing divorce, and particularly
                           because of his final interview, a young woman that
                           showed up from France to interview him. Then, the
                           other one was that Ajari was vying for his
                           position. In other words, that maybe the government
                           had got involved, but I never gave that one much
                           credence. But in the end, I think I figured it out,
                           ands I’m not gonna tell you because you’ll have to
                           watch the movie.
			   
1:57:01 Debra Schwartz:    Well, we’ll turn off the recorder. [chuckle] 
 
1:57:03 Mark Watts:        You can turn off the recorder, I’ll tell you
                           afterwards, I’ll tell you. [chuckles] 
 
1:57:04 Debra Schwartz:    After. 
 
1:57:06 Mark Watts:        But yeah, it was a very curious situation. And the
                           gong, the big gong, when he passed on, it sounded
                           once. That seemed like it was the signal for all the
                           monks to swoop in and clean up. Mary Jane says that
                           it’s what woke her. Alan sounding  the gong as he
                           left his body.  
 
1:57:28 Debra Schwartz:    You mean, after his death the gong went?  
 
1:57:31 Mark Watts:        Yeah, right. And it was heard throughout the
                           neighborhood. Three gongs was an emergency, but it
                           was a single gong. So, it was curious because it was
                           documented and the only person who was supposed to be
                           there other than him says that it woke her up and he
                           was deceased at the time. So, who sounded the gong?  
 
1:57:52 Debra Schwartz:    Was he alone? Was he not alone?  
 
1:57:54 Mark Watts:        Theoretically it was just the two of them in the
                           cabin. However, Ajari was nearby. He and his people
                           showed up 20 minutes later.  
 
1:58:05 Debra Schwartz:    Is that even legal to take a body?  
 
1:58:06 Mark Watts:        No. And that’s the other thing that was really weird
                           is that he was never ticketed or prosecuted for
                           that. Then later, very, very recently it came out a
                           completely different story that, “Oh no, that never
                           happened.” Although that was, you know, just
                           everybody knew that’s what happened for
                           years. There’s an official version now that, “Oh
                           no, he was cremated down at the local funeral parlor
                           like everybody else.”  So, it was very curious odd
                           cover-up.  
 
1:58:34 Debra Schwartz:    Try as you might to get accuracy in history it’s not
                           always so easy. 
 
1:58:39 Mark Watts:        Yeah, well it isn’t, and so actually we’re gonna do
                           some more research for this film, but we’re gonna
                           tell the story of how that all came about and we’re
                           also going to take the time to tell the story of my
                           exploration of that. And although, for the purposes
                           of the film, it’ll be all condensed into a short
                           period, it actually covered quite a few years, quite
                           a few years of exploration into that, and after you
                           turn off the recorder I’ll tell you how I found
                           out. A very brilliant man.  
 
   
# Techniken

## Inner Library

1:25:07 Debra Schwartz:    In order to do that, you have to have confidence in
                           the vast amount of learned wisdom and education that
                           you can draw from, which your father obviously
                           does. He has such a massive, [[inner library]].   

1:25:28 Mark Watts:        An inner library, as did Campbell, and it was just getting the 
					confidence to go out and wing it. 
 
## Spiraling

1:20:41 Debra Schwartz:    He is literally a weaver. He pulls the colors out and
                       he pulls things together and then he shows them to
                       you clearly in the most refreshing manner. His
                       concepts, his ideas, his illusions, everything was so
                       evocative that I think it really does  spark growth
                       in those that hear and appreciate what he’s saying. And even if you don’t  understand, you will, slowly. Things unfold in a wonderful story-telling manner.
			   
1:21:10 Mark Watts:            He called this spiraling. 
 
1:21:12 Debra Schwartz:    Spiraling?  
 
1:21:13 Mark Watts:        He used the story and then the concept. The story and
                           then the concept. I actually think it’s more of a
                           helix, that he’s going down and he’s going around
                           his content. What’s in the center is the
                           indescribable and then he weaves this wonderful
                           thing around it. I think that he was extremely
                           playful. He didn’t mind letting a few  tangents get
                           out there before he weaved them back in
                           again. Actually, in one of his talks,  I counted that
                           he’d left four out before coming back and picking
                           them all up in the correct  order and tying it all
                           together. He was a very skilled extemporaneous
                           speaker from an  organizational standpoint, even
                           though he didn’t speak from notes.

## Zu Drogen

He had no interest in any kind of drugs other than hallucinogenic, psychotropic drugs. [...] So, with pot he used it creatively. But anything stronger than that — [mescaline](Meskalin), [peyote](Peyote) — all of those things, he viewed as something that you used for religious purposes. He was not a fan of
recreational consumption of the strong psychedelics. He thought that it was a misuse, and also potentially pretty dangerous. He was famous for saying, “Once you get the message, hang up the phone.” I found that to be true, that you would receive information, there were gifts, depending on how you  wanna describe it, from the ingestion of these substances and if you didn’t implement them before you took more, you would sorta be reminded, “Hey, we already told you  that. And what are you doing?” It was if you had that attitude that it was a teacher or a sacrament, the relationship with it was very different. I had friends who were musicians  and pot dealers, who would just take their vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and L every day. And, yeah, pretty
soon it didn’t really work. In my father’s view, what their purpose was.

## Zu Psychologie
   
As I remember, my dad, when we first got together, he said, “So what do you wanna do? I’ll help you do whatever you wanna do.” And I said, “I wanna study psychology.” He said, “That’s a terrible choice, but I’ll help you anyway.” [chuckles] It took me some years to understand why he said that was a terrible choice, but he was talking about clinical psychology, the way
that it was practiced.

## Kritik

However, it should be recognized that Watts was a follower of [[Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki]] and the [Kyoto School](Kyoto-Schule), who intentionally mysticized Zen and other aspects of Japanese culture in order to appeal to the orientalist tendencies of "Western" audiences.
