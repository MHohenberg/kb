Leiter der [[Martinet Press]]

Laut Omega9Alpha / [[Order of Nine Angles]]:

In the matter of Joshua Sutter - the well-paid [[FBI]] agent provocateur - and his Martinet Press, and also his testimony at the trial of [[Kaleb Cole]], the antifascist ‘investigate journalists’ and antifascists themselves have failed to answer questions previously asked of them, even though they have based their entire post-2018 anti-O9A narrative and Campaign (i) around Sutter's black propaganda - which includes his Martinet Press books - and (ii) on his FB! supported infiltration of an America neo-nazi group and his years-long incitement to get young men to commit crimes including terrorism, paedophilia, and rape and (iii) on him associating the O9A with such crimes.
