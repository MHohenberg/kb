# London Bridge
Take the most famous game inherited from England, *London Bridge*, traditionally played in the United States with some curious variations. Basically, two children stand facing each other, hands clasped and arms raised to form an arch. The others run under the arch, until at a signal the arch descends and traps a child. When all players have been captured the American game ends with a tug-of-war - which lasts until one child lets go and breaks the line. That child is then victimized in some pre-arranged way. 
Other variations include the corruption of the original song:
	London Bridge is broken down;
		Dance o'er my lady lee
	London Bridge is broken down
		With a gay lady
These lines have now been drastically simplified to:
	London Bridge is falling down
		Falling down, falling down
	London Bridge is falling down
		My fair lady
But the change is just a normal mutation, no more significant than the use of in colonial Massachusetts of Charleston Bridge as the game's locale.
No, it is the act of 'trapping' players, and the final isolation of the victim, that most interests the folklorists. They see it a reflection of the world-wide belief that some sort of sacrifice is required for successful bridge building. Often, the victim was interred alive.
