In "The Key", [[Whitley Strieber]] describes a trifecta of religions:

* [Christianity](Christentum)
* [Islam](Islam), for submission to God
* [Buddhism](Buddhismus), for balancing things out.

He also records that "true gospel shows compassion", which I interpret that any part of a religious text that does not show compassion is thus not true gospel, but political. (It may be useful to assemble an overview book that only contains the parts that are compassionate)

## Where do I stand?

### Christianity

I have a basic idea and understanding about the Bible, but many parts of the Bible still are coloured mostly negative in my view. 

### Islam

Not much insight, but for the common knowledge (three to six prayers a day, ramadan, the duty to be charitable), Heavily coloured negatively due to constant religious conflict, terrorism, and the fact that youthful muslim immigrants tend to flock together and cause trouble. 

### Buddhism

Working understanding, mostly in [Zen](Zen) ideas. Weak on doctrine, but I think I got the idea. 

## So, where next

### The Bible / The Koran / Buddhism ... the good parts

Abridged and commented versions of the texts, just to separate the wholesome stuff from the semi-historical and the obviously political. Working copies for myself, and eventually being published (tbd) 

### Further understanding by reading spiritual texts of these traditions

- [[Meister Eckhart]] for Christianity
- [Sufis](Sufismus) for Islam (?)
