aka **שָּׂטָן, Satanas**

In the **Old Testament**, Satan appears as a challenger or accuser (e.g., **Job 1-2**, **Zechariah 3:1-2**).

In the **New Testament**, Satan is more explicitly a rebellious being opposing God and is equated with the [[devil]] (**Matthew 4:1-11**, **Luke 10:18**, **Revelation 12:9**).

From a Christian perspective, particularly influenced by later interpretations, these figures are usually considered different names or aspects of the same rebellious being. However, from a strict Old Testament and Jewish interpretation, these names describe different entities or metaphorical figures.
