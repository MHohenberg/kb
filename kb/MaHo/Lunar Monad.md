In [[Theosophie|Theosophical]] literature representing itself as ancient teachings gathered by occult means from the information available to adepts in Tibet at the beginning of the 20th Century, it is asserted that an ancient race, the "Lunar Monads" which later developed into the human beings we recognize as the authors of our recorded history, were not as solid or substantial as the creatures we know today, being less dense materially and having more "subtle" (pranic) energy per cubic centimeter of minerals and water which make up the organic body. What if this ancient legend, like the tale of the coelacanth, is actually true, and some of these "Lunar Monad"individuals survive today. manifesting as "bigfoot" and/or the more humanoid types of "extraterrestrials" reported as interacting with human beings?
