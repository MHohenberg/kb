Black cube of Mecca 666 nautical miles from the [[Tempelberg]] to Mecca

The [[Saphir]] (blue color) makes sense as the rainbow is the 5th (Cyan) and 6th note Saphire. 4th note is [Smaragd] (Venus / the morning star arising in the heart)..

The alchemists/cabalists say there is also this idea that you have the "[[Tablets of Testimony]]" ([[Smaragdene Tafel|emerald tablets]]) being separate from the actual Ten Commandments being the Sapphire that were in the [[Ark of the Covenant]].

England / the "Emerald Isle" is considered to typify the ending of the 4th keynote / start of the 5th keynote (4th green color on the rainbow)  or the "morning star" / Venus (dry land).. As continental Europe is the sanctuary or the waters or the "dark ages", hence "morning star of the reformation". England is also considered to be very well known for its sheep herding / lambskins cult of the Masonic Templars = land / lamb beast with the 2 horns of [[Jachin und Boaz|Jachin and Boaz]] calling fire down from heaven in Revelation 13:13.

Cube is also the cockpit of the airplane = lambskin seats

I should add, this explains the three middle colors of the poem  "a coming of Arthur"  Flame-colour, vert and azure (yellow, green and sky blue) three middle colors of the rainbow in order. As these represent priest and king (as the end goal of masonry is joining priest and king under one office)
