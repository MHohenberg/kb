# Signs of a bad service provider: Overpromising

## What is overpromising? 

After all, random problems do arise from time to time. 

Overpromising is using a promise for a service or perk that you afterwards consistently do not provide. 

* If one of your first class perk as a rail provider is to have food service on seat, you better not only provide it (especially when it comes to staple requests like coffee), you offer it unprompted. 
* More widely, if your promise for a service is a "premium experience", you cannot have trash laying around in the cabin, or the carpet being disfigured by a large stain, or have your app give customers random, contradicting messages. 
* If you promise a "quiet area", you better take steps to assure quiet is being kept - you better do not allow kids to be booked in those seats, react to user complaints of noisy co-travellers, and you should probably play some kind of white noise in that area. 

## When is not delivering not overpromising?

* one-off accidents do happen, and a service provider that otherwise has a spotless record did not overpromise when something outside of their control went wrong. Especially when that source outside of their control could not reasonably be expected to have been done in-house. If security at an airport did get haywire, you should not blame the airline for delays (it is reasonably fair to blame the airport, though). 
* Related to the previous point, if a service could not be rendered because a customer did not hold up their end of a deal, the service provider is without guilt. 

## How to deal with a service provider that consistently overpromises?

1. Avoid giving them business, where possible.
2. Do not pay them more than you must. If services and deadlines are consistently not met, it is time to renegotiate your business terms with them. 
3. Complain - but to so constructively. When a provider prioritizes services, one always is chosen over another. You can give valuable feedback on your priorities by telling a provider that a certain service - which they may have thought non-essential - was actually needed - and this gives a data point for the future.
