1. Think - become aware that time is passing, use this as a morning meditation. If we see time as actual entities, then we are less likely to waste them.
2. Importance - Determine priorities. 
3. Mission - You live in the moment. Do only what you are doing in this exact moment, do not worry about future activities. (see also: "When you eat, just eat" in [[Zen]]). 
4. Energy - time is energy. Energy means it has power. What you do in a moment lives on and has effects into the future (see also: [[Karma]]).

The purpose of life is to elevate every moment to the fullest possible way to sanctify/help the world around us.
