To some, minimalism is an aesthetic choice. To me, during my return from burnout, it became a mental health tool. 

Visual clutter is a constant stressor for your subconsciousness. Every book you have in your stack that you wanted to read for five years, but never did, is a constant reminder that you have failed reading that book. Every trinket you bought out of a whim did cost you money back then, and requires constant dusting right now. Few bring real joy, most just serve as reminders and mental anchors. 

And: they keep you anchored to the place you are in; They tie you to a version of yourself that doesn’t exist anymore. Should you decide your new life is as a guitarist on Madeira, guess what: All that *stuff* won’t disappear. You will have to pay to store it, or trash it. 

That is why it’s much better to reduce your belongings. 

There are countless books and methods out there, from Japanese housewives saying goodbye to each item to send it off, to fundamentalists who propose a ‘100 item max’ strategy. Here’s what worked for me:

1. Books: Chances are, you will never read them again. Donate them, or sell them off. 
2. Clothes: Donate anything that doesn’t fit you, is slightly worn out, or you haven’t worn in a year. 
3. Kitchen: Living a bachelor’s lifestyle, I have reduced my kitchen utensils to two knives, two forks, two spoons, two plates and a matcha bowl that doubles for morning cereals (somewhere in Japan, I just made it onto a government watchlist). I also own two mugs. Not only is that manageable, it also prevents me from filling the sink until it becomes an ecosystem. I also threw out all expired or rarely-used ingredients. Instead I now focus on recipes that have few ingredients, and are working around a common core of spices. 
4. Office space: Do you really need a drawer full of random pens and pencils? Probably not. Give them to kids for drawing, and keep only what truly works for you: To me, that was a good ink roller pen, a solid mechanical pencil, and a few quality tools depending on workflow.
   
   I also treated myself to one upgrade that changed everything: a large mousepad as a desk liner (look for “game mats” in a neutral color). It makes the desk feel clean, organized, and like a place you actually _want_ to work at.
5. Hide the clutter that you cannot get rid of. This includes the little nest of cables that come with any modern electronic lifestyle. Get yourself a cable box, hie them in it. Instantly cleaner. Be aware you will do good to open i, from time to time, and let the vacuum cleaner do its job.

Minimalism isn’t about living with nothing. It’s about keeping what supports your life – and letting go of what doesn’t.
