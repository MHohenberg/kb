This is for if you decide to change the stage. For that to function, you need clarity on two major questions:

1. What stage do you want to get *onto*? Do you seek solitude, or company? A change in scenery, or a different view on the one you are in? 
2. … and how will you survive? This is about the necessities - food, shelter, money, and highly dependant on the stage. If you decide to live in Santa Monica, that’s likely going to be a more relevant question than if you decide to become a Monk in a monastery (regardless to where that monastery would be). 

From these questions derive a whole bouquet of decisions. 
## What stage?

The ‘stage’ question requires some soul-searching, and is relatively vague. We all are different, we all seek relief in a different way. Some dream of that hermit’s hut in the mountains, some just want to make music, some need to wander the Earth, some find happiness drawing comic spaceships in their basements, some seek God, or Enlightenment, the other a partner that loves them. 

So go, make yourself a hot beverage, sit down in a comfortable chair, close your eyes, and start fantasising: how would your perfect day look like? Go into detail. 

When would you wake up, in which environment? Breakfast, or a run? Would you go to a market for groceries? would you look at the rain falling over a valley with a forest covering everything? Do you hear the sounds of an airport terminal, or the bells of a Tibetan monastery? 

What would you eat? Describe the smells, and the tastes. 

Would people know you, or not? Are you a teacher, or a seeker, or a craftsman, or an artist? Is there someone in your life to come home to (if you are currently in a relationship: is it your current partner)? 

Will you party at night, or read, or make love? 

When would you go to sleep, and with what ritual?

It is wise to do this a few times. You will notice there will be variations, but there also will be a common core. And that’s where you want to be - the stage you want to be on. 

Until now, this was daydreaming - some call it ‘visualising’ and claim it is a magical method to receive from the universe. That’s fine. You’ve been exploring possibilities, feeling out what resonates.

But now comes the turning point: with the next question, the dream stops being a fantasy and starts becoming a plan.

**How do I get there?**

## Value, money, and survival

The money question is more *actionable.*
1. Sell stuff, and pay off debt. Less stuff means less mental load. See the chapter on [[../../Books/The art of Resetting/Minimalism]]. This will remove anchors that keep you down in the current prison you find yourself in - both physically and mentally - and when the debtor does not come knocking, you do not need to work to pay him. Which makes you a freer person. 
2. How much money do you *really* need per month to live in relative comfort? This involves rent, health, food, mandatory payments (don’t forget the small stuff, many countries have a number of extra fees, e.g. TV fees), clothing, the ocassional haircut … You may be surprised how small that number can be. Now add 50%, to create a safety cushion for when bad things happen. And add whatever your tax bracket says you owe the taxman.
3. Now ask yourself: what can I do - that I like - that creates this kind of money? Emphasis here is on ‘like’. You are not *fleeing* your current situation - you are actively choosing a new life. It’s your right to decide what it shall be.
