Yes, you are suffering from burnout. But nothing is wrong with you as a person -  you are the best in the world at being you. 

Does that mean you can slack off, or be an asshole to everyone? Sure. 

But being you means playing your role. And that means others will react to your role. 

When your life is hard, that means the role you play is not in synch with the stage you are on. 
This immediately gives you two options: 

1. Put on another mask. Change. This is what people will most likely tell you, though they will use less nice words to do so: ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’, ‘Grow a spine!’, ‘Endure’. And in some ways, that is legitimate. 
   
2. Change the stage you play on. If your mind is chillstep hippie, but your stage is corporate high-stress, guess what: it will break you. Maybe a life with less stress, less challenges, more peace is better suited for you. Be aware: this will come with consequences. Your income will change. Maybe your people will change. In extreme cases, there might be times of actual strife, too. And should you only find your stage climbing the Himalayas, there is a good chance your life will be significantly shorter as compared to the coziness of a cubicle. 
   
But right now, you are suffering. And suffering means: you either are not aware of your options, or unwilling to chose.
