The idea hat while we may think we are living in an n-dimensional universe, all information needed to describe it may actually be encoded in a (n-1)-dimensional medium. 

This could technically go on (the description itself being encoded in (n-2)), until some sort of ultimate 0D-code - with binary being a strong contender. This ultimately makes it another example of the duality of existance - 0 and 1, [[Yin and Yang]].

On the other hand - it implies that any dimension encodes the dimension immediately above it.
