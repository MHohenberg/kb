* 8. Februar 1810 in Paris; † 31. Mai 1875 ebenda

Esoteriker, Zeremonialmagier und Okkultist. Schrieb über 20 Bücher über [[Magie]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Alchemie]] und [[Okkultismus]]

Autor von _The History of Magic_ (übersetzt ins Englische von [[Arthur Edward Waite]] ), dort stellt Levi neun Grundregeln der Magie auf:
1. There is a potent and real Magic, popular exaggerations of which are actually below the truth.
2. There is a formidable secret which constitutes the fatal science of good and evil.
3. It confers on many powers apparently super-human.
4. It is the traditional science of the secrets of Nature which has been transmitted to us from the Magi.
5. Initiation therein gives empire over souls to the sage and full capacity for ruling human wills. 
6. Arising apparently from this science, there is one infallible, indefectible and truly catholic religion which has always existed in the world, but it is unadapted for the multitude. 
7. For this reason there has come into being the exoteric religion of apologue [parable], fable and wonder-stories, which is all that is possible for the profane : it has undergone various transformations, and it is represented at this day by Latin Christianity under the obedience of Rome.
8. Its veils are valid in their symbolism, and it may be called valid for the crowd, but the doctrine of initiates is tantamount to a negation of any literal truth therein. 
9. It is Magic alone which imparts true science.
