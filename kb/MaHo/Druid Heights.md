Location in einem Nationalpark in Marin County nördlich von [[San Francisco]]. Wirkungsstätte von unter anderem [[Alan Watts]]. 

Ursprünglich gescheiterte Farm.

In 1954, hoping to escape from the increasing urbanization of Fairfax, Gidlow
bought a 5-acre property in rural Marin County near Muir Woods. Gidlow wanted to
create a community for her varied friends and felt that the atmosphere in
Fairfax had shifted. The property had been found by Roger Somers and his wife
Mary, but they did not have the funds to make the purchase. Despite the
inability of single women to obtain credit at the time, Gidlow was able to
borrow funds, after her friend Dorothy Erskine collateralized the loan. The
two couples shared the property, naming it Druid Heights, and moved in shortly
before the summer solstice.

The group renovated the two houses on the property, converted the barns, and
piped water for the buildings and gardens.

## 1972 Spannungen und Expansion der Community

1:35:24 Edmund Stiles:    About 1972, I would guess. Roger had gotten a new lady
                          in his life, and she had a lot of connections in the
                          underworld of San Francisco. I didn’t really
                          understand it all, at this time. I didn’t realize that
                          that’s where these people came from. But Roger had
                          been building little residential spaces, and renting
                          them out to people, and taking cash under the counter,
                          so to speak. It was kind of his retirement plan, I
                          guess you could say. So there were more and more and
                          more people all the time, and there were interesting
                          things going on all around us all the time. I resented
                          it some, because to me the beauty and privacy of the
                          place was what I most loved about it. And also, I
                          liked the way our relationships were, all of us, Roger
                          and Elsa and myself, and Marilyn and our kids. By that
                          time, our kids were young children.

1:37:06 Edmund Stiles:    Well, yeah. The partying got harder, and the drugs got
                          harder. I was aware of all that up to a point, but I
                          think I said earlier that I loved the wild and
                          wooliness of the entire West Coast experience. When I
                          got here, it was so open by comparison where I’d come
                          from, and it was what I wanted. By the way, I thought
                          I was just gonna go to New Zealand, but once I really
                          saw what Sausalito and the West Coast was like at that
                          time, I thought, “Is this still America? Holy cow,
                          this is good enough for me.” So I never went any
                          farther than that, and I’ve been here ever since. When
                          the drug thing got heavy in the ’70s — Marilyn and I
                          grew up in a mafia town back east, and in so doing you
                          learn things that you see, you understand things that
                          are going on around you, that maybe other outsiders
                          wouldn’t.

1:37:56 Edmund Stiles:    And so I had an awareness that, I think, maybe was a
                          little unique for this group of people. They were all,
                          at that point, kinda West Coasters. I don’t know about
                          Roger’s own perceptions, but some of these people were
                          getting a little wilder and woolier and some of them
                          appeared to be a little bit nuts, and it’s hard to say
                          how much of that was drugs. I was offered acid all the
                          time. There was plenty of LSD, acid. The original
                          Clear Lite was around and a lot was available. I chose
                          not to participate. I was trying to build myself up
                          and not bring myself down. 			   

1:39:03 Edmund Stiles:    Well, yeah, more and more, but the people were getting
                          harder, too. There were more people of questionable
                          intent and lack —

1:39:56 Edmund Stiles:    Yeah, well, that’s the thing. As a person who grew up
                          around mafia, I recognized the element. I didn’t know
                          who it was exactly, I didn’t need to. I just knew that
                          the fun days were over and the heavy guys were moving
                          in. It wasn’t a good friend, but he was a good friend
                          of a good friend, and I’d hired this man to work for
                          me because he was a master carpenter and I needed help
                          on one of my projects in town, and he just didn’t
                          function. I wound up going to my friend and saying,
                          “Do we need to be worried for him, because there was
                          something really wrong.” And my friend said, “Yes, we
                          do.” And then this man disappeared and turned up dead
                          a few days later and he was murdered. It turned out he
                          was a gunrunner, but that’s another story. So there
                          were all kinds of things.

1:40:46 Edmund Stiles:    Yes, I had a problem, because two days, sequentially,
                          maybe within three days of each other, there were a
                          lot of people living on the property, including some
                          young attractive women. And one of them came to me one
                          day — I’m in the shop doing my thing, working away —
                          and she came into the shop and said, “Are you gonna be
                          here today, all day?” And I said, “Yeah, why?” And she
                          said, “Well, I don’t wanna be here if you’re not
                          here.” And I said, “Why?” And she said, “Well, because
                          there’s this crazy guy walking around here and he’s
                          hitting on me all the time and he comes around and he
                          tells me that he’s staying up in the woods at night
                          with a loaded rifle to protect us from the narcs and
                          the little green people from outer space.” And I
                          thought, “Oh, really?” ’Cause I’d gotten used to
                          seeing people stoned on acid and partying down and
                          having a nice time, day or night, it didn’t matter.

1:41:35:                  I kinda liked all the people playing. They’re jumping
                          up and down on cars naked. I didn’t care as long as it
                          wasn’t my car and as long as it wasn’t in my
                          house. Once in a while, they’d drift into my house and
                          drift back out again, but it wasn’t a problem. Again,
                          I rather enjoyed all of that wackiness, but when it
                          turned to heavy drugs,  and then I found out that
                          there were lots of guns and a lot of false identities
                          down at Roger’s main farmhouse, which he had rented to
                          a bunch of people, that changed my overall
                          alertness. And then when this woman came to me and 
                          said what she said, I went, “Oh, boy. This has gone
                          way beyond anything I realized.” I was raising two
                          sons there, and Marilyn was working in her studio just
                          a few hundred yards, a few feet away, really, and I
                          had kept her a little bit in the dark about some of
                          the things I knew that were building up. But the
                          upshot of it was that, all of a sudden, I thought,
                          “Oh, my God. I put my family at risk and didn’t know
                          it.”
			  
1:42:35 Edmund Stiles:    Because I wasn’t paying attention. I didn’t pay enough
                          attention, and I was too casual. So, I probably didn’t
                          handle this very well, but it was unusual territory
                          for me to say anything negative to Roger. I loved
                          Roger, and I trusted him. So I called him up and he
                          was on a job somewhere, and I said, “Roger, your
                          empire  is out of control. You have got to reel it
                          in.” And he said, “I don’t have an empire.” It was the
                          first time we ever had bad words between us, and he
                          got all very huffy because I used the wrong approach,
                          I suppose you could say, and I wasn’t very diplomatic
                          about this.  This really freaked me out. I didn’t say
                          also that after the first incident, about two days
                          later, another woman, also resident of the property,
                          came and said almost the same thing about this guy. I
                          never met this guy at the time. I didn’t know who he
                          was, had never seen him. If I saw him, I didn’t know
                          who he was, but he was related to one of the
                          characters that was renting Roger’s farmhouse at the
                          time, [[Walter Voorhees]] by name.  
 
1:43:37:                  And then, I had a woman that worked for me from time
                          to time on a property that I owned in town. She was
                          smart and experienced and I trusted her, and she said,
                          “Oh, his name is actually — they know him as Rocky in
                          the city, and he’s involved in drug murders over
                          there.” I’m not the FBI. I don’t know how to check
                          these things out, so I just had to take it at face
                          value, that’s what I was told. The combination of
                          those two women, and my woman friend, who seemed to
                          know what she was talking about at the time — by the
                          way, I’m not sure that she did, now in retrospect, but
                          that’s what she said to me. So I thought, “Okay, this
                          guy is not the player that he seems to be. He’s
                          something  else entirely.” And as, again, an observer,
                          I realized that he would disappear for periods of
                          time, that made no sense. I suddenly realized that,
                          “Oh, my God, I let this go way too far.” And I was
                          heavily invested at that point. I owned property
                          there. I built the house for Thea. I was a primary
                          owner of the place, at this point, and my world was
                          there. I built my world there.
			  
1:44:44:                  All of a sudden it just came crashing down, because if
                          Roger wouldn’t help me reel it in some — and I wasn’t
                          asking for a lot, I just needed it to be not entirely
                          crazy. And the guns and the drugs — the drugs were
                          never gonna go away — but the guns were an issue for
                          me. And crazy people were an issue for me. This guy
                          was  supposed to have been a Vietnam burnout, who came
                          home crazy. Never met him. Roger reacted very strongly
                          and was insulted that I would imply that something was
                          wrong with — he said, “I don’t have an empire,” and,
                          “Blah, blah, blah,” and then he just blew me  off. I
                          never challenged Roger for the place in any manner,
                          shape, or form. I wound up  being there, working
                          there. I worked on his buildings gratis. I just gave
                          him what I had of myself to give. And in turn, when I
                          needed something from him, he wouldn’t even  45
                          discuss it. He thought it was nuts. He actually went
                          to Marilyn and said, “What’s wrong with Ed? Has he
                          flipped out? Has he lost his mind?” And that really
                          did it.

1:45:51 Edmund Stiles:    It was Roger’s place. It was always Roger’s
                          place. It’s like  they say, “You’re there at the
                          discretion or the pleasure of the president.” Well,
                          Roger was the president. I was always there at the
                          pleasure of Roger, and he had welcomed me. I loved him
                          for that. He gave me what I most wanted at the time,
                          and then it ended because I wasn’t welcome there
                          anymore. I couldn’t be comfortable that I was honoring
                          my family obligations onto that circumstance without
                          help from him to at least slow it down some and assess
                          it some. He wouldn’t do it. So I thought, “Okay.” I
                          was in the middle of furnishing that Catholic Church,
                          I think, so I was really caught between a rock and a
                          hard place.

2:04:06 Edmund Stiles:    No, and that was a big part of the deterioration of
                          the whole thing. when GGNRA was formed and they came
                          in to buy all the land in the valley and everywhere
                          else in West Marin, they didn’t have enough money to
                          do it properly, so they simply made offers that were
                          low. Roger took the money immediately and got what he
                          could, and in so doing, he also sold things that were
                          mine and kept the money, which is, by the way, another
                          thing I found a little hard to accept. I’d actually
                          even said to him, “You know, if they give you money
                          for my hot tub” — which was on his land, admittedly —
                          I said, “I expect you to give it to me.” And they did;
                          and he didn’t. I learned through a circuitous series
                          of things that they paid him $6,000 and he hadn’t
                          given me anything. So those kinds of violations,
                          around money, I had never expected that, but Roger
                          became very, very focused on the money. And when you
                          start dangling money in front of people who have been
                          living kind of off of their efforts in going
                          day-to-day with not much in reserve, it changes
                          everything, very quickly.
