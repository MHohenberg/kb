Boleskine House is described and recognisable in [W. Somerset Maugham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham "W. Somerset Maugham")'s _[The Magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(Maugham_novel) "The Magician (Maugham novel)")_ where it is called "Skene". Crowley considered Maugham's book to be plagiarism and wrote an article under the name of Oliver Haddo (the name of a character taken from Maugham's book) for _[Vanity Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine) "Vanity Fair (magazine)")_ as a witty riposte. (For details, see Crowley's autobiography, _Confessions_, listed above.) In [Neil Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Spring "Neil Spring")'s novel _The Burning House_ the house plays a major role.
