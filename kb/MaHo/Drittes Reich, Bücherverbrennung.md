The burning (of the [Torah](Torah)) continued a practice familiar from May [[1933]], when the Nazis burned books all over Germany. The meaning of the burning of the books was not determined by the precise literary knowledge of the participants and the audience, who most often had not read the books or even heard about the authors. The burning was the meaning.[^1]
