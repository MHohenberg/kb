First official encounter, 11:25pm. Primary witness: Antonio F. 
Dog barked at home. Antonio F., being a right-wing bodyguard, feared for the safety of his family, considering the left-terrorist activity of the [[Red Brigade, Italy|Red Brigade]]. He crawled to his window to peak out, whether this may be an assassin. Instead, he witnessed a 'dazzling light' about 130 meters from the front gate, which he first thought to be a headlight of a broken-down car. Realizing the light was too high above the road, he reconsidered, and saw a 15-30 meter large segmented object, floating above the road. Originally glowing orange, it changed to purple and silver as well. He called for his family so that they would witness the UFO, but when they have arrived, the UFO was gone - all testified that they had seen a flash of multicoloured light. 

Frustrated, he left to go back watching TV, when his dog again barked. Investigating, he encountered two extremely thin humanoid figures, one about 2 meters, one about 1,80 meters, standing around 30 meters away from him. Their thin faces reminded him of the women [[Andreo Mondigliani]] painted. They had large, almond-shaped eyes, 'broader on the outside, and thinner on the inside of the head'. They wore a skin-fitting suit, held by a belt with a silver buckle, which may or may not have glowed (or reflected the flashlight). They noticed him, and for a moment they all were in a stunned silence. Then he called for his family again, just when the aliens were leaving.

The followed moment, he investigated where the the ufo hovered - finding a patch of burned grass about 2 meters in diameter. He investigated where the Aliens were standing, and discovered that one had stood on a little hill, while the other one stood in a ditch, so it is possible there was no height difference at all.
