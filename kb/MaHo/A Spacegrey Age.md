I suddenly have to pay for the simplest of softwares - for instance, I am writing this on a "minimalist" Markdown editor - essentially a text editor with no visible UI interface, which automatically formats Markdown information into something resembling a potential output in HTML. It is nice, it makes writing easier (and, let's be honest: All I do here I could achieve with emacs). But it also costs 15 bucks, and given the rather limited functionality, for a simple thing like this, it does seem overly expensive. So expensive, in fact, that I consider learning XCode and recreating this program (I want to point out: several very similar programs exist on the App Store, none of which are "free"). On Linux, a program like this would have been FOSS - free *and* open source - neither of which Typist is.
