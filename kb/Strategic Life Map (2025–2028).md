 **🗺️ Martin Hohenberg: Strategic Life Map (2025–2028)**

---

### 🌌 Core Vision Statement

> _"To live as an integrated creator, building systems, stories, and sanctuaries that reflect my inner clarity and serve others with meaning."_

---

### 🧭 3-Year Guiding Document

**Why:**

- To reclaim personal agency after burnout
    
- To live at peace with body, mind, and environment
    
- To turn my ideas into sustainable, income-generating structures
    

**Three Core Projects:**

1. **Pokémon Card Empire**: Full-spectrum shop (static frontend, API backend, smart pricing, streamlined logistics)
    
2. **Lux Umbrae**: A living grimoire, occult system, and reflective project that builds my myth and offers value
    
3. **Dystopia Engine**: A narrative world built on systemic rules, feeding a novel trilogy and possible game
    

**Five Non-Negotiables:**

1. No compromising sleep, food, or movement for work
    
2. No kitsch or shallow work—depth is sacred
    
3. Always default to self-hosted or privacy-preserving systems
    
4. Refactor complexity instead of fleeing it
    
5. Protect quiet time: daily solitude is mission-critical
    

**Things I Quit:**

- Overengineering before MVP
    
- Apologizing for ambition or obscurity
    
- Systems that don’t talk to each other
    
- Taking work from clients who drain me
    
- Keeping things “just in case”
