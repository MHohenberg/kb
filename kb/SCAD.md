A symposium in the February 2010 issue of _American Behavioral Scientist_ , one of our leading social science journals, argues that social scientists need to develop a scientific approach to studying an increasingly important type of criminality: **State Crimes Against Democracy**, abbreviated SCADs, [69](https://911truth.org/building-what-how-scads-can-be-hidden-in-plain-sight/#69) understood as “concerted actions . . . by government insiders intended to manipulate democratic processes and undermine popular sovereignty.” Having the “potential to subvert political institutions and entire governments . . . [SCADs] are high crimes that attack democracy itself.”

Distinguishing between SCADs that have been officially proven, such as “the [[Watergate]] break-ins and cover-up . . . , the secret wars in Laos and Cambodia . . . , the illegal arms sales and covert operations in [[Iran-Contra]] . . . , and the effort to discredit [[Joseph Wilson]] by revealing his wife’s status as an intelligence agent,” on the one hand, and _suspected_ SCADs for which there is good evidence, on the other, the symposium authors include in the latter category “the fabricated attacks on U.S. ships in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] in 1964 . . . , the “October Surprises” in the presidential elections of 1968 . . . and 1980 . . . , the assassinations of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy . . . , the election breakdowns in 2000 and 2004 . . . , the numerous defense failures on September 11, 2001 . . . , and the misrepresentation of intelligence to justify the invasion and occupation of Iraq.” 

Besides regarding 9/11 as one of the suspected SCADs for which there is good evidence, this symposium treats it as its _primary_ example. The abstract for the introductory essay begins by asserting: “The ellipses of due diligence riddling the official account of the 9/11 incidents continue being ignored by scholars of policy and public administration.” [72](https://911truth.org/building-what-how-scads-can-be-hidden-in-plain-sight/#72) The symposium’s final essay, criticizing the majority of the academic world for its “blithe dismissal of more than one law of thermodynamics” that is violated by the official theory of the World Trade Center collapses, [73](https://911truth.org/building-what-how-scads-can-be-hidden-in-plain-sight/#73) also criticizes the academy for its failure to protest when “Professor Steven Jones found himself forced out of a tenured position for merely reminding the world that physical laws, about which _there is no dissent whatsoever_ , contradict the official theory of the World Trade Center Towers’ collapse.” [74](https://911truth.org/building-what-how-scads-can-be-hidden-in-plain-sight/#74) 

The authors of this symposium point out, moreover, that the official theory of the destruction of the three World Trade Center towers has serious implications for science and engineering. If NIST’s explanation “provides the most robust account of the Towers’ collapse, based on known science,” then some previously accepted physical laws would need to be revised:
